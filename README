- dwm - 
1. Added lots of cutom key bindings that do not
conflict with any other program in this repository
2. The bar was heavily modified to be more minimal and 
take up less space, with 100% mouse support as well.
3. Added window hide/show functionality that can be 
activated using mouse clicks on appropriate bar cell.
When window is hidden it is shown with darker color on the
bar, and you can't switch to it when cycling windows.
4. There are many extra window layouts that can be cycled

- st -
1. Not many changes here besides auto copy to system 
clipboard, and keyboard select patch. All colors are 
set to standard and the font used is terminus-ttf-4.47.0
located in this repository

- slstatus -
1. The only interesting part is the config.h where
I chose to display only the useful info

- grabc - 
1. No differences to original program, but it's too
useful to not include

- xkeyboard -
(see submodule readme)

- utils -
1. tinycc.c is a special version of tcc that tries to almaginate 
C source files. It has correct preprocessing of #include and 
the rest of the spec. So to use it pass in -E option.  
2. cembed.c & tinypgm.c a utility that I made to work with 
pgm images and convert them to C hex arrays. I mainly used 
when developing xkeyboard.
3. amal.c attempt to do what tinycc.c does but it is not accurate, 
don't use it, I keep it just as a template code for when I want to
build another utility program.

- neatvi -
(see submodule readme)

- surf -
1. I took a fork from Francesco as a base, see the Readme in
surf directory. I have removed the dependency on gcrt which is
bloated certificate library, but in exchange now it's much easier
to build surf, only webkitgtk2 is needed.

- mailx -
1. Custom build, not no significat changed as of yet.
