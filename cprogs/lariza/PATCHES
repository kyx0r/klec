                           Patches and forks
                           =================


What and where?
---------------

The project used to be hosted on GitHub, so there is a couple of forks:

    https://github.com/vain/lariza/network/members

I'm not aware of any non-GitHub forks at the moment.


Why?
----

This project has a rather strict policy when it comes to accepting
patches. Feature requests often get turned down. I apologize for that.

Let me quote http://suckless.org/hacking:

    There are two types of patches: The ones that fit to your personal
    taste and the ones you think should be included in mainline.

Bug fixes and the like should be included in mainline and I'm very happy
to receive pull requests for those types of things. Patches that fit
your personal taste are a different story. They will probably not be
accepted. Sorry.

I recognize that you put effort into your work. Let's not waste it. If
you wish your patches to be included in this list, just drop me a note.

Thank you!
