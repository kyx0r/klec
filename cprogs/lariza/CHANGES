Release history for lariza

v21.01  2021-01-22
  [Changed]
  - The file "adblock.black" has been renamed to "adblock".

v20.08  2020-08-29
  [Fixed]
  - Middle-click to open in a new tab has been improved. In certain
    conditions, the user's intention to open a new tab has been ignored
    and URLs haven been opened in the current tab.
  - When new tabs are opened in the background, the web view is now
    focused by default.

v20.07  2020-07-19
  [Fixed]
  - Build no longer depends on GNU sed.

v20.05  2020-05-15
  [Changed]
  - lariza now uses native GTK tabs instead of relying on suckless
    tabbed. See also:

  - Keyword searches have been removed, as these code paths were
    unmaintained. See also:
    https://www.uninformativ.de/blog/postings/2020-05-01/0/POSTING-en.html
  - The "external URI handler" has been removed, as these code paths
    were unmaintained. See also:

  - WebKit sandboxing is now enabled. While considered stable, it is a
    rather new feature. Please report breakages. This also requires you
    to run at least WebKitGTK 2.26 (released 2019-09-09). See also:

  [Added]
  - Allow webkit:// in URLs.

v20.04  2020-04-22
  [Fixed]
  - Minor fixes to manpages.

v20.03  2020-03-28
  [Changed]
  - Makefile: Web extensions and user scripts will be installed.
  - "enable-developer-extras" is now always set to "TRUE". This enables
    the Web Inspector.
  - WebGL is enabled in WebKit by default these days. lariza's
    environment variable $LARIZA_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_WEBGL is gone.

  [Added]
  - User-supplied JavaScript files can be put into
    ~/.config/lariza/user-scripts. "hints.js" is one such script, it's
    bundled with the main application, but must be activated manually by
    copying or linking it to said directory.

v19.05  2019-05-05
  [Fixed]
  - We no longer use WebKit's deprecated JavaScript API.

v18.07  2018-07-29
  [Added]
  - The input bar now shows an indicator for web feeds.

    The icon used for this purpose is the stock icon called
    "application-rss+xml-symbolic". It is somewhat "non-standard", i.e.
    not defined by [0], but appears to be present in many icon themes.
    Let me know if it doesn't work for you.

v18.06  2018-06-24
  - This is a maintenance release, due to the project moving away from
    GitHub. No code changes.

v18.03  2018-03-17
  [Fixed]
  - Accidentally opening a context menu and then issuing a middle click
    to open a new tab no longer changes the location of the original tab
    (fixes #56). (This only happened under certain circumstances.)

v18.01  2018-01-27
  [Fixed]
  - Compilation warnings regarding deprecated API calls (GtkAction) have
    been addressed. Thanks to @jun7 on GitHub!

v17.11  2017-11-16
  [Added]
  - You can now set the following environment variable to have console
    output printed to STDOUT: LARIZA_ENABLE_CONSOLE_TO_STDOUT.

v17.10  2017-10-18
  [LICENSING]
  - The project has been relicensed under the MIT license (more
    precisely called "Expat License", but everyone calls it "MIT
    license" these days).

v17.07  2017-07-02
  [Fixed]
  - User input is now properly escaped when used for keyword based
    searching (fixes #47).

v17.05  2017-05-21
  [Fixed]
  - Automatically adding the "file://" prefix didn't work (reliably) if
    a message was sent to an already running instance.

  [Changed]
  - Autoreloading of crashed web processes has been removed. It doesn't
    make sense anymore since the switch to webkit's multi-process model.
    Instead, we now simply announce the crash in the location bar.
  - Refuse to quit if there are active downloads. The user has to cancel
    them explicitly. (To improve workflow a little bit, the download
    manager now also knows a "Mod1 + q" hotkey.)

  [Added]
  - WebGL can now be enabled by setting an environment variable. This is
    an experimental feature, though.

v17.02  2017-02-16
  [Fixed]
  - As requested by WebKit's API documentation, we now wait for the
    "ready-to-show" signal after a "create" signal. This fixes crashes
    after you chose "Open link in new window" from a context menu.

  [Changed]
  - The "search prefix" has been changed from "/" to ":/". This means,
    in order to search for text in a web page, you now have to enter
    something like ":/your search term" into the input box.
  - Lariza now uses WebKit's multi-process model. This means that (most)
    tabs run as independent processes. If one tab crashes, it should not
    affect the others.
  - The GtkLevelBar to show page loading progress has been removed.
    Instead, we now use the progress bar which is already included in
    GtkEntry (the input box). This is mostly a cosmetic change, but it
    also eliminates some GTK warnings.

  [Added]
  - An external user-supplied program can be called for the current URI
    or for hyperlinks/images/videos/audio files.
  - Lariza will now automatically add a "file://" prefix for local
    files.
  - Hotkeys have been unified. It is now largely irrelevant whether the
    location bar or the web view has focus.
  - Lariza can be instructed to write each visited URI to a file.

v16.12  2016-12-24
  [Fixed]
  - Lariza no longer reports download progress below 0% or above 100%.
    (Workaround for what appears to be a WebKit2GTK+ bug.)

  [Changed]
  - We no longer explicitly set the X11 window's class and name. Let
    GTK+ do this job. The actual class and name should be unchanged,
    though (WM_CLASS(STRING) = "lariza", "Lariza").

    This does not affect tabbed which is still run with "-n lariza".

    This change fixes a GTK+ deprecation warning.

v16.09  2016-09-03
  [Changed]
  - Web extensions are now looked for in ~/.config/lariza/web_extensions.

v16.06  2016-06-26
  [Fixed]
  - Gtk warnings.

  [Changed]
  - Except for the default window size, there are no hardcoded pixel
    values anymore. Should make it a little easier to run lariza on
    HiDPI screens. (Sorry, not tested, I don't have one.)

  [Added]
  - New key bindings F2 and F3: Go backward and forward, just like the
    existing mouse key binds do.

v16.01  2016-01-05
  [Fixed]
  - Issue #14: "Keypad enter" now registers as "commit", i.e. "start
    loading the URL" or "begin searching for search term".
  - Issue #15: lariza no longer tries to create local file names with
    directory separators in them when downloading files.
  - lariza no longer sets the window title to an empty string.

  [Changed]
  - For the sake of consistency, $LARIZA_WEB_EXTENSIONS_DIR has been
    removed.

  [Added]
  - Manpages are now available.

v15.09 and earlier releases
  - Sorry, the CHANGES file did not exist back then. Please refer to the
    Git log.
